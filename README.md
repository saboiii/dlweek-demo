# Deep Learning Week '25 is coming soon! ðŸš€
<br/>
This is a secure demo website for our upcoming Deep Learning Week event with a hidden easter egg. Built using NextJS and TailwindCSS for the frontend, and Node.js and Axios for the backend. To optimize media delivery and data storage, I've used AWS S3 and Lambda with Cloudwatch.<br/>
<br/>
The hidden easter egg features a PhaserJS game that runs using an embedded Tensorflow AI model which makes the game harder the more users play it. The web application designed using security best practices is now deployed on Netlify at dlweek.com.<br/>
